## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned that using transform: translate(-50%,-50%) helps you position an img at the exact center. I also learned about the position element and the z-index that helps positioning and specifies the stack order of the elements.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
### Continued development
 My focus is on css animations which is slightly challenging me
